<!-- Extra Stuff: May or may not use -->

<!--<p>Greetings Dark Crystal lover. The four boxes below contain characters from YOUR favorite 		movie ever, The Dark Crystal! Each character is holding onto (hording) a certain number of 			Dark Crystals.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Once upon a time, we would rejoice with our weird looking movie friends and celebrate their wealth of crystals. However, times have changed since Dark Crystal was first shown in theaters. Dark Crystals can be sold on the black market for massive profits.</p>
