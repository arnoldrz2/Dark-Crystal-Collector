Remember the movie "The Dark Crystal"? I was a quirky kind of movie, especially compared to stuff we see today.

Anyway, feel free to play my "Crystal Collector" style game, Dark Crystal Collector! The game will randomly generate a target number, and will randomly assign hidden number values to each image on the page. The user's number starts at "0", but will increase when the user clicks on any of the images. Its up to the user to try to match their number with the target number. As the user wins and loses, the wins/loses counters will increase (as long as the page is not refreshed).
